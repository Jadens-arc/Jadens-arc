My name is Jaden Arceneaux. I'm a self-taught programmer based in Las Vegas, Nevada. I currently work as a full-stack web developer. I've been programming since I was 13 and I've been on GitHub since I was 15. This account showcases showcases highlights of my work from my very first Python project to now.

Although I am currently employed but I absolutely love working on open-sourced projects. Feel free to check out some of my projects listed below or reach out to me if you want help with yours. My email is [contact@jadenarceneaux.com](mailto://contact@jadenarceneaux.com) and my personal website is [jadenarceneaux.com](https://jadenarceneaux.com)

Much love ❤️
